            <h5> It is the most burning issues in the world right now affecting individuals, communities, culture and
                society migration. As an artist I have been deeply and vividly inspired and influenced by this
                phenomenon. I have large variety of art media like drawing, prints, mixed media, sculpture and
                installation. I used to explore and experiment with surface and material value and figurative body
                with respective journey of migrants like train, bag, thaila, plastic house equipment. If we talking
                about value of material and surface I transform them into new perspective and surface. Title
                “Transformation of Material” used cow dung and transform into the electric heater, and other work
                “Migration” transform zinc plate into the kitchen vessels and tarajoo machine.

                I grew up in Bihar and it is known for migrant people across India, where lacs of people migrated just
                for surviving and fulfil their family basic needs. They follow others and moved to the city. Some of
                case they moved in season, some of them move for the adjusting for the short time. I used to
                explore the process of recreating image between two objects or shape. Most of the work flux
                moving, changing or finding one place to the other, new place, language culture routine and
                behaviour in new perspective of routine might not be come easy. They feel socially isolated and
                adjust however. Their existence in new place how multifaceted interpretation effect society
                everywhere both physically and psychologically.
